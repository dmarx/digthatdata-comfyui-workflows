# DigThatData's Advanced ComfyUI Tips and Tricks!

Apparently I've been attempting to share workflows on social platforms that were cleaning the metadata from the images! Whoops!

My goal here is mainly to encapsulate specific tips and tricks that can be incorporated in larger workflows, rather than publishing standalone, "do everything" workflows. 

The reason for this is that... well, that's just not how I use comfyui. I'll usually start from a base "simple" workflow, and build up a piece as I interact with it. My process tends to be very organic in this way, so by the time I'm finally happy with a piece: it probably has its own unique workflow. Rather than turning this into a gallery to show off how much effort goes into each piece, I'm going to try to use this space mainly to share more "atomic" techniques that I sometimes use.

To use the techniques described here, the easiest approach is probably to open up a **second** comfyui browser tab, load the my workflow you're interested in there (i.e. drag the png image onto the comfyui workspace), select and copy the nodes that comprise the trick, then go back to your main comfy tab and paste that chunk of the my workflow into your workspace.
